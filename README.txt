QUICK START
-----------
The script make.sh calls a Makefile (accepts the same parameters: all, clean, ...) to compile Hadoop and all its dependencies. It will create three folders:

- /hadoop-src: the original Hadoop source with the applied patches (located in /patch).
- /hadoop-build: Hadoop built from /hadoop-src (with the Extrae injection included).
- $HOME/instrumentation: binaries and libraries needed during execution and post-process steps. It's outside the repo folder (/vagrant/workspace) because the mount point that vagrant creates is incompatible with some permissions.

The next step is to copy some folders to all the nodes of the Hadoop cluster. When using vagrant, the repo folder is shared between all the nodes so no need to copy it, but the folder $HOME/instrumentation has to be copied manually (it only changes when recompiling).

Once everything is in place, the script run.sh runs all the steps needed for the instrumented execution of Hadoop. By default will launch a grep job (located in /jobs/default.sh), but a different job can be specified as a parameter. For example "./run.sh sort" will launch a sort job located in /jobs/sort.sh

After the execution is done, every node has the traces generated stored locally. The final step is to run the script post-process.sh that will copy the traces from all the nodes, merge them in a single file, and fix some things (like synchronization and complete communications). The output directory is /traces, with the definitive file named /traces/mergeoutput-out.prv that can be opened with Paraver. Some Paraver custom views are already configured inside the /CFGs folder.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Some scripts need environment variables with different paths set (like make.sh and post-process.sh). All these scripts load the file /vars.sh, that will load /vars-default.sh (with all the default options) and, if found, the file /vars-local.sh (that is ignored from version control). If some option needs to be overriden, just create that file and put it there.


PATCHES
-------
- hadoop-compile-java7.patch: Hadoop 1.0.3 has an error and doesn't compile with java7, this patch fixes it.
- hadoop-extraewrapper-inject.patch: injects Extrae events inside the Hadoop code.
- hadoop-extraewrapper-inject.patch.withwalas: old version from Sergio, not used anymore.
- hadoop-build-classpath.patch: adds extraewrapper.jar (with the Extrae code to generate the events) to the build process. Also removes some unnecessary build targets to speed up compilation time.
- hadoop-launch-classpath.patch: adds extrae libraries to java library path for execution.
